## Visualizing the app hierarchy

This is essential when building an app, to help with and planning and think through your component hierarchy.

In this tutorial, we’re going to build a Todo app using Meteor and React.  We'll be taking a somewhat different approach from [the official Meteor React tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app) and adding a few more bells and whistles along the way.

- [Finished version of the app](http://intro-to-meteor-react.meteor.com/)
- [Github Repo](https://github.com/CodeChron/intro-to-meteor-react)

##Prerequisites 
- Basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and use of a command line terminal.
- A laptop with a code editor of your choice.  We’ll be using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3 ).
- Be sure to [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install). We’ll be using Mac OSX. However, Meteor is available for Windows and Linux as well.

## Getting Started
Each step in the tutorial has a corresponding branch in the [github repo](https://github.com/CodeChron/intro-to-meteor-react).  I highly recommend that you create the app on your own, but if you should get stuck, you can always check out the branch from the previous step to get caught up.

### Getting caught up using git branches.
1. Clone the tutorial: ```git clone https://github.com/CodeChron/intro-to-meteor-react.git```
2. Cd into the tutorial project: ```cd intro-to-meteor-react```
2. Pull down all branches: ```git pull --all```
3. View available branches: ```git branch -a```

Now, you should be all set to get caught up to a tutorial step if needed.

# Overview

- Show the finished app we'll build in the weekend workshop.
- Discuss major features covered.
- As a preview, we're going to build a click-to-edit component.
- Create a dumb text block component.
- Enable the component to accept click events.
- Add a container component that handles the click event.
- Change the state of the container component to be edit state.
- Add a textarea component.
- Add some styling to make it full screen.
- Associate with data backend.
