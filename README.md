# Preview of Full-stack Web Development with Meteor and React
In this tutorial, we’re going to build a simple web app using using Meteor and React. This will be a simplified version of a more advance app we'll build in a two-day workshop on full-stack web development with Meteor and React.

## What we'll cover today

- Show the finished app we'll build in the weekend workshop.


## The app we'll build
_TODO: insert screen cap of finished app_
_TODO: demo the app_
- _Add github link_

- TODO: list major features


### The app we'll build in the full course
_TODO: insert screen cap of finished app for full course_
_TODO: demo the app_

- Additional topics covered:
- Additional components, such as click to edit
- Login and Authentication
- Routing
- Security
- Handling list scaling
- Deployment





- [Finished version of the app](http://intro-to-meteor-react.meteor.com/)
- [Github Repo](https://github.com/CodeChron/intro-to-meteor-react)

##Prerequisites 
- Basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and use of a command line terminal.
- A laptop with a code editor of your choice.  We’ll be using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3 ).
- Be sure to [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install). We’ll be using Mac OSX. However, Meteor is available for Windows and Linux as well.

## Getting Started
Each step in the tutorial has a corresponding branch in the [github repo](https://github.com/CodeChron/intro-to-meteor-react).  I highly recommend that you create the app on your own, but if you should get stuck, you can always check out the branch from the previous step to get caught up.

### Getting caught up using git branches.
1. Clone the tutorial: ```git clone https://github.com/CodeChron/intro-to-meteor-react.git```
2. Cd into the tutorial project: ```cd intro-to-meteor-react```
2. Pull down all branches: ```git pull --all```
3. View available branches: ```git branch -a```

Now, you should be all set to get caught up to a tutorial step if needed.
