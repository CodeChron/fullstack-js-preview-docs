# Add a basic app header

Here, we have a static app header and a component that submits that was input to a handler.

## Add an app header and a page title component
- Discuss: adding useful default values to components.
- Discuss: why not just include a page title in the app header?

## Add a single field submit component
- Discuss component naming
- After creating: where will the data go?

NOTE: May be introducing styling and SASS already here.
