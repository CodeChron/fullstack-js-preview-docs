# App Component Hierarchy

React uses a hierarchical component architecture.  The React model encourages taking a visual approach to defining your app.  (See [Thinking in React - “Start with a mock”](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html).) Therefore, let's start with some mockups of the app views we'll be creating.

A key purpose of this exercise is to think about what each component will be responsible for.
