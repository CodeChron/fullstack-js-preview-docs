# Dealing with Data
- Many options
- Official Meteor solution uses a mixin, which is being phases out
- Upcoming options are still in flux, so will stick with this until Meteor provides an updated official version.

- install meteor-react-data package and npm react-mixins
- waiting for subscriptions to be ready
- adding a Loading utility component
- Components: create an example to explain re-binding scope and how ```this``` works
