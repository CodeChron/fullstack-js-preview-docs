# Note Details View
- refactor AppHeader so it just accepts props (and works on both home and note details)
- on note details, do edit title first?  Edit Title would be an auto-save feature
- Discuss: display loading while waiting for subscription to be ready will be a common functionality, however, let's wait until we have two instances where it is needed before refactoring it out into its own function.
- What about edit note/view note?
- What about just using the first line as the title?
- Next: updated mocks for note detail
